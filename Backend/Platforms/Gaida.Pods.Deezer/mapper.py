One Deezer REST track object as the pod result shape every other pod hands over -- no ``contentUrl``,
which the pod cannot build because it does not know the public host.

Unlike the Spotify pod's mapper this one describes something playable: the ID it produces is what
``/content`` is later asked for. The three routes that produce tracks (``get_track``, ``search_track``,
``get_playlist_tracks``) all return the same object, so there is one spelling of every field.
